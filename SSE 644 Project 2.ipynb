    "Introduction\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper presents the topics learned in  the first three chapters of *IPython Interactive Computing and Visulization Cookbook* by Cyrille Rossant.  IPython is a command shell for interactive computing.  It was originally developed for Python, however it can be used in multiple programming languages.  Python 3.6 was used in Jupyter Notebook for this project.  Jupyter is a web based interactive notebook used for displaying and sharing of scientific research so that results and work can easily be understood by other researchers.  The user is able to write code in cells and run each cell individually or multiple cells together.  The output is shown below the cell.  This is extremely useful, as the user can run and troubleshoot cells one at a time.  Cells can output much more than just strings and calculations.  Cells also can output rich text and multimedia in order to explain the code as the user goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython is ideal when learning to analyze and visualize data.  Python is a language that enables people to quickly and efficiently write code to solve problems. It uses simplified syntax for readability as well as contains libraries that will perform large tasks for programmers.  This paper discusses the project developed to demonstrate the topics learned in the text and also highlights some additional topics.  The final code and indirect activity report are included in the appendices.\n"

    "\n",
    "Even though engineering is a growing field, there are still many more males than females in the field.  I have experienced this discrepency myself ad I was the only female electrical engineering major at Mercer University in my year.  My mother, who graduated as an electrical engineering major 30 years ago, also experienced the discrepency in male-female engineers in universities.  I am extremely interested in analyzing the statistics of female engineers in the United States and thus have focused on this in this paper.\n",
